{"overview":"Inverted Section tags and End Section tags are used in combination to wrap a\nsection of the template.\n\nThese tags' content MUST be a non-whitespace character sequence NOT\ncontaining the current closing delimiter; each Inverted Section tag MUST be\nfollowed by an End Section tag with the same content within the same\nsection.\n\nThis tag's content names the data to replace the tag.  Name resolution is as\nfollows:\n  1) Split the name on periods; the first part is the name to resolve, any\n  remaining parts should be retained.\n  2) Walk the context stack from top to bottom, finding the first context\n  that is a) a hash containing the name as a key OR b) an object responding\n  to a method with the given name.\n  3) If the context is a hash, the data is the value associated with the\n  name.\n  4) If the context is an object and the method with the given name has an\n  arity of 1, the method SHOULD be called with a String containing the\n  unprocessed contents of the sections; the data is the value returned.\n  5) Otherwise, the data is the value returned by calling the method with\n  the given name.\n  6) If any name parts were retained in step 1, each should be resolved\n  against a context stack containing only the result from the former\n  resolution.  If any part fails resolution, the result should be considered\n  falsey, and should interpolate as the empty string.\nIf the data is not of a list type, it is coerced into a list as follows: if\nthe data is truthy (e.g. `!!data == true`), use a single-element list\ncontaining the data, otherwise use an empty list.\n\nThis section MUST NOT be rendered unless the data list is empty.\n\nInverted Section and End Section tags SHOULD be treated as standalone when\nappropriate.\n","tests":[{"name":"Falsey","desc":"Falsey sections should have their contents rendered.","data":{"boolean":false},"template":"\"{{^boolean}}This should be rendered.{{/boolean}}\"","expected":"\"This should be rendered.\""},{"name":"Truthy","desc":"Truthy sections should have their contents omitted.","data":{"boolean":true},"template":"\"{{^boolean}}This should not be rendered.{{/boolean}}\"","expected":"\"\""},{"name":"Context","desc":"Objects and hashes should behave like truthy values.","data":{"context":{"name":"Joe"}},"template":"\"{{^context}}Hi {{name}}.{{/context}}\"","expected":"\"\""},{"name":"List","desc":"Lists should behave like truthy values.","data":{"list":[{"n":1},{"n":2},{"n":3}]},"template":"\"{{^list}}{{n}}{{/list}}\"","expected":"\"\""},{"name":"Empty List","desc":"Empty lists should behave like falsey values.","data":{"list":[]},"template":"\"{{^list}}Yay lists!{{/list}}\"","expected":"\"Yay lists!\""},{"name":"Doubled","desc":"Multiple inverted sections per template should be permitted.","data":{"bool":false,"two":"second"},"template":"{{^bool}}\n* first\n{{/bool}}\n* {{two}}\n{{^bool}}\n* third\n{{/bool}}\n","expected":"* first\n* second\n* third\n"},{"name":"Nested (Falsey)","desc":"Nested falsey sections should have their contents rendered.","data":{"bool":false},"template":"| A {{^bool}}B {{^bool}}C{{/bool}} D{{/bool}} E |","expected":"| A B C D E |"},{"name":"Nested (Truthy)","desc":"Nested truthy sections should be omitted.","data":{"bool":true},"template":"| A {{^bool}}B {{^bool}}C{{/bool}} D{{/bool}} E |","expected":"| A  E |"},{"name":"Context Misses","desc":"Failed context lookups should be considered falsey.","data":{},"template":"[{{^missing}}Cannot find key 'missing'!{{/missing}}]","expected":"[Cannot find key 'missing'!]"},{"name":"Dotted Names - Truthy","desc":"Dotted names should be valid for Inverted Section tags.","data":{"a":{"b":{"c":true}}},"template":"\"{{^a.b.c}}Not Here{{/a.b.c}}\" == \"\"","expected":"\"\" == \"\""},{"name":"Dotted Names - Falsey","desc":"Dotted names should be valid for Inverted Section tags.","data":{"a":{"b":{"c":false}}},"template":"\"{{^a.b.c}}Not Here{{/a.b.c}}\" == \"Not Here\"","expected":"\"Not Here\" == \"Not Here\""},{"name":"Dotted Names - Broken Chains","desc":"Dotted names that cannot be resolved should be considered falsey.","data":{"a":{}},"template":"\"{{^a.b.c}}Not Here{{/a.b.c}}\" == \"Not Here\"","expected":"\"Not Here\" == \"Not Here\""},{"name":"Surrounding Whitespace","desc":"Inverted sections should not alter surrounding whitespace.","data":{"boolean":false},"template":" | {{^boolean}}\t|\t{{/boolean}} | \n","expected":" | \t|\t | \n"},{"name":"Internal Whitespace","desc":"Inverted should not alter internal whitespace.","data":{"boolean":false},"template":" | {{^boolean}} {{!
