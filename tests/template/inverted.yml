overview: |
  Inverted Section tags and End Section tags are used in combination to wrap a
  section of the template.

  These tags' content MUST be a non-whitespace character sequence NOT
  containing the current closing delimiter; each Inverted Section tag MUST be
  followed by an End Section tag with the same content within the same
  section.

  This tag's content names the data to replaceÂ the tag.  Name resolution is as
  follows:
    1) Split the name on periods; the first part is the name to resolve, any
    remaining parts should be retained.
    2) Walk the context stack from top to bottom, finding the first context
    that is a) a hash containing the name as a key OR b) an object responding
    to a method with the given name.
    3) If the context is a hash, the data is the value associated with the
    name.
    4) If the context is an object and the method with the given name has an
    arity of 1, the method SHOULD be called with a String containing the
    unprocessed contents of the sections; the data is the value returned.
    5) Otherwise, the data is the value returned by calling the method with
    the given name.
    6) If any name parts were retained in step 1, each should be resolved
    against a context stack containing only the result from the former
    resolution.  If any part fails resolution, the result should be considered
    falsey, and should interpolate as the empty string.
  If the data is not of a list type, it is coerced into a list as follows: if
  the data is truthy (e.g. `!!data == true`), use a single-element list
  containing the data, otherwise use an empty list.

  This section MUST NOT be rendered unless the data list is empty.

  Inverted Section and End Section tags SHOULD be treated as standalone when
  appropriate.
